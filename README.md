# Rabtwit
Rabtwit is a Python tool for hashtag hijacking with fun. It sends lovely (rab)tweets filled with a random Google image of a chosen topic (default: cute bunnies) and randomly chosen hashtags from a file. The hashtag #rabtwit is added to every tweet to recognize normal tweets from (rab)tweets. The posting frequency is customizable. Let's flood Twitter with tenderness ;)
